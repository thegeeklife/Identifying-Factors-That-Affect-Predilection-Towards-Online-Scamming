# Factors-Affecting-Predilection-Towards-Scamming
Understanding the psychological and sociological techniques used by scammers is an important part of identifying and trying to address the root cause of online fraud attacks. While some research focusing on the experiences and psychology of victims of these attacks as well as the countermeasures that can be taken to protect them from such attacks exists, there is little research on the psychology and motivation of those who commit online fraud. This project aims to uncover motivations of online fraudsters. 

# Surveys Used 
The Surveys_used folder consists full surveys that have been used in the study. However, in order to reduce survey fatigue, I only included certain sections of some of the survey scales. 
DOSPERT Risk Perception Scale:
  Included only Social, Financial and Ethical risk questions
CCRI:
  I chose a subset of 30 questions from the survey and had participants indicate "Yes" or "No" for indulging in those acts.
 The PDF attached shows a list of questions that were asked, excluding the demographics collected.

# Data Used 
The data that was used is not included because of confidentiality agreement. However, since the surveys used have been provided the results should be reproducible.
